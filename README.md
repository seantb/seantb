- 👋 Hi, I’m Sean Beckwith
- 👀 I’m interested in ocean sciences, specifically the CO2-carbonate system, salinity-calcium ratios, and global change. 
  Using large data sets from gliders and other platforms, I am looking for useful ways to elucidate patterns in the data.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, machine-learning, BASH and other things Git.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on glider data analysis.
- 📫 How to reach me:  stbeckwith@usf.edu
